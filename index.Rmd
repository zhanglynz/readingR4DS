# Preface {.unnumbered}

Here are my notes on reading **R for Data Science 2nd Ed**. The book's URL is: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/

This is only for my own study.

# Welcome

"This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You'll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it and visualize."

# Introduction

![](figs/data_science_process.PNG)

1. "First, you must import your data into R. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) and load it into a data frame in R." [file; database; API]

1. "In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation."

1. "Once you have tidy data, a common next step is to transform it." [main engines are: `dplyr` and `data.table` packages]

1. "A good visualization will show you things you did not expect or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that you're asking the wrong question or that you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, but they don't scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them." ["A picture is worth than thousand words."]

1. "Models are fundamentally mathematical or computational tools, so they generally scale well." "But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature, a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you."

1. "The last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project." [communication]

1. "There's a rough 80/20 rule at play: you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools you'll learn in this book, but you'll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20%." [80/20 rule]

1. "The tools you'll learn throughout the majority of this book will easily handle hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a bit of care, you can typically use them to work with a few gigabytes of data." [100 MB - a few GB] "If you're routinely working with larger data (10–100 GB, say), we recommend learning more about data.table."

1. "You need four things to run the code in this book: R, RStudio, a collection of R packages called the tidyverse, and a handful of other packages. Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data." [R; RStudio; tidyverse; other packages]

1. " Upgrading [R] can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions that require you to re-install all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse." [Q: how to update R and easily re-install all R packages?]

1. "RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE" [IDE]

1. "An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R." [R package]

# Data visualization

1. "ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs." [grammar of graphics]

1. "aesthetic mappings and geometric objects – the fundamental building blocks of ggplot2" [aes; geo]

1. "ggthemes package, which offers a colorblind safe color palette." [ggthemes; colorblind safe]

1. [A population is a (tidy) table, where each row is for an item/unit/element and each column is an attribute of the items/units/elements.]

1. "Once you've made a plot, you might want to get it out of R by saving it as an image that you can use elsewhere. That’s the job of `ggsave()`"

# Workflow: basics

1. "You will make lots of assignments, and <- is a pain to type. You can save time with RStudio's keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign)." [shortcut for <-]

1. "R will ignore any text after # for that line." [comment]

1. "Use comments to explain the why of your code, not the how or the what." [explain why in comment]

1. "For data analysis code, use comments to explain your overall plan of attack and record important insights as you encounter them." [plan and insights in comment]

1. "Object names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, _, and .." [object name]

1. "You want your object names to be descriptive, so you'll need to adopt a convention for multiple words. We recommend snake_case, where you separate lowercase words with _." [snake case]

1. R is case sensitive.

# Data transformation

1. "If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, you'll need to use their full names: stats::filter() and stats::lag()." [full name of a function: pkgname::func_name]

1. "when we need to be precise about which package a function comes from, we'll use the same syntax as R: packagename::functionname()."

1. "The easiest way to pronounce the pipe is 'then'." [pipe]

1. dplyr verbs for rows: filter; arrange; distinct; count

1. dplyr verbs for columns: mutate; select; rename; relocate

1. "You can rename variables as you select() them by using =. The new name appears on the left hand side of the =, and the old variable appears on the right hand side"

1. "If you have a bunch of inconsistently named columns and it would be painful to fix them all by hand, check out janitor::clean_names() which provides some useful automated cleaning." [janitor::clean_names()]

1. keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M for %>% or %>%

1. The slice_ functions:

    - df %>% slice_head(n = 1) takes the first row from each group.
    - df %>% slice_tail(n = 1) takes the last row in each group.
    - df %>% slice_min(x, n = 1) takes the row with the smallest value of column x.
    - df %>% slice_max(x, n = 1) takes the row with the largest value of column x.
    - df %>% slice_sample(n = 1) takes one random row.
    
1. "Whenever you do any aggregation, it’s always a good idea to include a count (n()). That way, you can ensure that you're not drawing conclusions based on very small amounts of data." [show the sample size] 

# Workflow: code style

1. "Using a consistent style makes it easier for others (including future-you!) to read your work and is particularly important if you need to get help from someone else." [future you]

1. "As a general rule of thumb, it's better to prefer long, descriptive names that are easy to understand rather than concise names that are fast to type." [descriptive names]

1. "if you have a bunch of variables that are a variation on a theme, you're better off giving them a common prefix rather than a common suffix" [common prefix]

1. "Pipe sign should always have a space before it and should typically be the last thing on a line." [pipe]

1. "be wary of writing very long pipes, say longer than 10-15 lines. Try to break them up into smaller sub-tasks, giving each task an informative name." [break long pipes]

1. "create these headers (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)" [headers]

# Data tidying

1. "most built-in R functions work with vectors of values. That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural." [vectors]

1. "tidyr provides two functions for pivoting data: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider()." [pivot_longer; pivot_wider]

1. "A more challenging situation occurs when you have multiple pieces of information crammed into the column names, and you would like to store these in separate new variables." [multiple pieces of information in a column name]

1. "The examples we presented here are a selection of those from vignette("pivot", package = "tidyr"), so if you encounter a problem that this chapter doesn’t help you with, that vignette is a good place to try next." [vignette("pivot", package = "tidyr")]     

**Example:**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
 
tbl <-
  tribble(
    ~id, ~x_1, ~y_2,
    "a", 1,   2,
    "b", 3,   4,
    'c', 5,   6)
new_tbl <-
  tbl %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = x_1:y_2,
    names_to = c("name", "number"),
    names_sep = "_",
    values_to = "value"
  )
new_tbl
```


# Workflow: scripts and projects

1. "If you’re using RStudio server, your R session is never restarted by default." "This makes it even more important to regularly restart R so that you’re starting with a clean slate." [restart R]

1. "Keeping all the files associated with a given project (input data, R scripts, analytical results, and figures) together in one directory is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for 
	this via projects." [project]   

1. "You should never use absolute paths in your scripts, because they hinder sharing: no one else will have exactly the same directory configuration as you."	[relative paths]

1. "we recommend always using the Linux/Mac style with forward slashes in paths." [forward slashes]

#  Data import

1. "CSV, which is short for comma-separated values"	[csv]

1. "By default, read_csv() only recognizes empty strings ("") in this dataset as NAs" ["" is default for NA]

1. "janitor::clean_names() to use some heuristics to turn them all into snake case at once" [janitor::clean_names(); snake case]
	
1. a useful function `base::list.files()`

# Visualize

ggplot2 extensions gallery https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/. This site lists many of the packages that extend ggplot2 with new geoms and scales. It's a great place to start if you're trying to do something that seems hard with ggplot2

# Layers

1. "You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at
    https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html." [aesthetic specifications]

1. "Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument, either defined locally in the geom layer or globally in the ggplot() layer." [global or local mapping for geom]	

1. "ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the linetype example). It is convenient to rely on this feature 
because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms." [separate geometric objects]	

1. "If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. 
This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers." [local mapping]
"You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer." [local data]

1. "the ggridges package (https://wilkelab.org/ggridges) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable." [ggridges package]	

1. "The best place to get a comprehensive overview of all of the geoms ggplot2 offers, as well as all functions in the package, is the reference page:
	https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference."	

1. "The first argument of facet_grid() is also a formula, but now it’s a double sided formula: rows ~ cols." [facet_grid()]

1.  "By default each of the facets share the same scale and range for x and y axes." "Setting the scales argument in a faceting function to "free" will allow for different axis scales across 
both rows and columns, "free_x" will allow for different scales across rows, and "free_y" will allow for 
different scales across columns." [`facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = "free_y")`]

1. "You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to “jitter”. position = "jitter" adds a small amount of random noise to each point."	[`geom_point(position = "jitter")`]
"Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with 
a shorthand for geom_point(position = "jitter"): geom_jitter()." [`geom_jitter()`]

1. `coord_flip()`  

## An Example

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_point(
    data = mpg  %>%  filter(class == "2seater"), 
    color = "red"
  ) +
  geom_point(
    data = mpg  %>%  filter(class == "2seater"), 
    shape = "circle open", size = 3, color = "red"
  )
```

## Exercise

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
 
p1 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
 
p2 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group = drv), se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE)
 
p3 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
 
p4 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(color = 'blue', se = FALSE)
 
p5 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), color = 'blue', se = FALSE)
 
p6 <-
  mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point()
 
(p1 | p2) / (p3 | p4) / (p5 | p6)
```


# Exploratory data analysis 

1. "you always need to investigate the quality of your data" [data quality]

1. "Your goal during EDA is to develop an understanding of your data. The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset." [understanding of data; asking questions]

1. "EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions." [many questions; quality questions]

1. "To make it easy to see the unusual values, we need to zoom to small values of the y-axis with coord_cartesian()" [`coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))`] 
"coord_cartesian() also has an xlim() argument for when you need to zoom into the x-axis."
 
## Example of using `fct_reorder`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## order class by median of hwy
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_reorder(class, hwy, median), y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Plot two categorical variables

### Example of using `geom_count()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
  geom_count()
```

### Example of using `geom_tile()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
diamonds %>% 
  count(color, cut) %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n))
```

# Communication

1. "you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible." [self-explanatory]

1. Three useful packages for creating graphs: sacales; ggrepel; patchwork

1. "The easiest place to start when turning an exploratory graphic into an expository graphic is with good labels. You add labels with the labs() function." [`labs()`]

1. "The purpose of a plot title is to summarize the main finding. Avoid titles that just describe what the plot is, e.g., 'A scatterplot of engine displacement vs. fuel economy'." [plot title]

1. "If you need to add more text, there are two other useful labels: subtitle adds additional detail in a smaller font beneath the title and caption adds text at the bottom right of the plot, often used to describe the source of the data." [subtitle; caption]

1. "geom_text() is similar to geom_point(), but it has an additional aesthetic: label. This makes it possible to add textual labels to your plots." "fontface and size arguments we can customize the look of the text labels." [`geom_text()`]

1. "Use geom_hline() and geom_vline() to add reference lines. We often make them thick (linewidth = 2) and white (color = white), and draw them underneath the primary data layer." [`geom_hline()`; `geom_vline()`]

1. "Use geom_rect() to draw a rectangle around points of interest. The boundaries of the rectangle are defined by aesthetics xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax." [`geom_rect()`]

1. "Use geom_segment() with the arrow argument to draw attention to a point with an arrow. Use aesthetics x and y to define the starting location, and xend and yend to define the end location." [`geom_segment()`]

1. "Another handy function for adding annotations to plots is annotate(). As a rule of thumb, geoms are generally useful for highlighting a subset of the data while annotate() is useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot." [`annotate()`]

up to 11.4 Scales

## Examples

**Example 1: showing outliers**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

potential_outliers <- mpg %>%
  filter(hwy > 40 | (hwy > 20 & displ > 5))
  
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text_repel(data = potential_outliers, aes(label = model)) +
  geom_point(data = potential_outliers, color = "red") +
  geom_point(
    data = potential_outliers,
    color = "red", size = 3, shape = "circle open"
  )
```

**Example 2: using annotate()**

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
trend_text <- "Larger engine sizes tend to have lower fuel economy." |>
  str_wrap(width = 30)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  annotate(
    geom = "label", x = 3.5, y = 38,
    label = trend_text,
    hjust = "left", color = "red"
  ) +
  annotate(
    geom = "segment",
    x = 3, y = 35, xend = 5, yend = 25, color = "red",
    arrow = arrow(type = "closed")
  )
```
