"],["introduction.html", "2 Introduction", " 2 Introduction First, you must import your data into R. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) and load it into a data frame in R. [file; database; API] In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Once you have tidy data, a common next step is to transform it. [main engines are: dplyr and data.table packages] A good visualization will show you things you did not expect or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that youre asking the wrong question or that you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, but they dont scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them. [A picture is worth than thousand words.] Models are fundamentally mathematical or computational tools, so they generally scale well. But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature, a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you. The last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. communication Theres a rough 80/20 rule at play: you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools youll learn in this book, but youll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20%. [80/20 rule] The tools youll learn throughout the majority of this book will easily handle hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a bit of care, you can typically use them to work with a few gigabytes of data. [100 MB - a few GB] If youre routinely working with larger data (10100 GB, say), we recommend learning more about data.table. You need four things to run the code in this book: R, RStudio, a collection of R packages called the tidyverse, and a handful of other packages. Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data. [R; RStudio; tidyverse; other packages]  Upgrading [R] can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions that require you to re-install all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. [Q: how to update R and easily re-install all R packages?] RStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE [IDE] An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. [R package] "],["data-visualization.html", "3 Data visualization", " 3 Data visualization ggplot2 implements the grammar of graphics, a coherent system for describing and building graphs.

[ggthemes; colorblind safe] [A population is a (tidy) table, where each row is for an item/unit/element and each column is an attribute of the items/units/elements.] Once youve made a plot, you might want to get it out of R by saving it as an image that you can use elsewhere. Thats the job of ggsave() "],["workflow-basics.html", "4 Workflow: basics", " 4 Workflow: basics You will make lots of assignments, and &lt;- is a pain to type. You can save time with RStudios keyboard shortcut: Alt + - (the minus sign). [shortcut for &lt;-] R will ignore any text after # for that line. [comment] Use comments to explain the why of your code, not the how or the what. [explain why in comment] For data analysis code, use comments to explain your overall plan of attack and record important insights as you encounter them. [plan and insights in comment] Object names must start with a letter and can only contain letters, numbers, _, and .. [object name] You want your object names to be descriptive, so youll need to adopt a convention for multiple words. We recommend snake_case, where you separate lowercase words with _. [snake case] R is case sensitive. "],["data-transformation.html", "5 Data transformation", " 5 Data transformation If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, youll need to use their full names: stats::filter() and stats::lag(). [full name of a function: pkgname::func_name] when we need to be precise about which package a function comes from, well use the same syntax as R: packagename::functionname(). The easiest way to pronounce the pipe is then. [pipe] dplyr verbs for rows: filter; arrange; distinct; count dplyr verbs for columns: mutate; select; rename; relocate You can rename variables as you select() them by using =. The new name appears on the left hand side of the =, and the old variable appears on the right hand side If you have a bunch of inconsistently named columns and it would be painful to fix them all by hand, check out janitor::clean_names() which provides some useful automated cleaning. [janitor::clean_names()] keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M for %&gt;% or %&gt;% The slice_ functions: df %&gt;% slice_head(n = 1) takes the first row from each group. df %&gt;% slice_tail(n = 1) takes the last row in each group. df %&gt;% slice_min(x, n = 1) takes the row with the smallest value of column x. df %&gt;% slice_max(x, n = 1) takes the row with the largest value of column x. df %&gt;% slice_sample(n = 1) takes one random row. Whenever you do any aggregation, its always a good idea to include a count (n()). That way, you can ensure that youre not drawing conclusions based on very small amounts of data. [show the sample size] "],["workflow-code-style.html", "6 Workflow: code style", " 6 Workflow: code style Using a consistent style makes it easier for others (including future-you!) to read your work and is particularly important if you need to get help from someone else. [future you] As a general rule of thumb, its better to prefer long, descriptive names that are easy to understand rather than concise names that are fast to type. [descriptive names] if you have a bunch of variables that are a variation on a theme, youre better off giving them a common prefix rather than a common suffix [common prefix] Pipe sign should always have a space before it and should typically be the last thing on a line. [pipe] be wary of writing very long pipes, say longer than 10-15 lines. Try to break them up into smaller sub-tasks, giving each task an informative name.

That makes transforming tidy data feel particularly natural. [vectors] tidyr provides two functions for pivoting data: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). [pivot_longer; pivot_wider] A more challenging situation occurs when you have multiple pieces of information crammed into the column names, and you would like to store these in separate new variables. [multiple pieces of information in a column name] The examples we presented here are a selection of those from vignette(pivot, package = tidyr), so if you encounter a problem that this chapter doesnt help you with, that vignette is a good place to try next.

This makes it even more important to regularly restart R so that youre starting with a clean slate. [restart R] Keeping all the files associated with a given project (input data, R scripts, analytical results, and figures) together in one directory is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects.

This site lists many of the packages that extend ggplot2 with new geoms and scales. Its a great place to start if youre trying to do something that seems hard with ggplot2 "],["layers.html", "11 Layers 11.1 An Example 11.2 Exercise", " 11 Layers You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html. [aesthetic specifications] Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument, either defined locally in the geom layer or globally in the ggplot() layer. [global or local mapping for geom] ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the linetype example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms. [separate geometric objects] If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers. [local mapping] You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. [local data] the ggridges package (https://wilkelab.org/ggridges) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable. [ggridges package] The best place to get a comprehensive overview of all of the geoms ggplot2 offers, as well as all functions in the package, is the reference page: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference. The first argument of facet_grid() is also a formula, but now its a double sided formula: rows ~ cols. [facet_grid()] By default each of the facets share the same scale and range for x and y axes. Setting the scales argument in a faceting function tofree will allow for different axis scales across both rows and columns, free_x will allow for different scales across rows, and free_y will allow for different scales across columns. [facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, scales = \"free_y\")] You can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to jitter. position = jitter adds a small amount of random noise to each point. [geom_point(position = \"jitter\")] Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for geom_point(position =jitter): geom_jitter().

The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset. [understanding of data; asking questions] EDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions. [many questions; quality questions] To make it easy to see the unusual values, we need to zoom to small values of the y-axis with coord_cartesian() [coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))] coord_cartesian() also has an xlim() argument for when you need to zoom into the x-axis. 12.1 Example of using fct_reorder ## order class by median of hwy ggplot(mpg, aes(x = fct_reorder(class, hwy, median), y = hwy)) + geom_boxplot() 12.2 Plot two categorical variables 12.2.1 Example of using geom_count() ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = color)) + geom_count() 12.2.2 Example of using geom_tile() diamonds %&gt;% count(color, cut) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = color, y = cut)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = n)) "],["communication.html", "13 Communication 13.1 Examples", " 13 Communication you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible. [self-explanatory] Three useful packages for creating graphs: sacales; ggrepel; patchwork The easiest place to start when turning an exploratory graphic into an expository graphic is with good labels. You add labels with the labs() function. [labs()] The purpose of a plot title is to summarize the main finding. Avoid titles that just describe what the plot is, e.g., A scatterplot of engine displacement vs. fuel economy. [plot title] If you need to add more text, there are two other useful labels: subtitle adds additional detail in a smaller font beneath the title and caption adds text at the bottom right of the plot, often used to describe the source of the data. [subtitle; caption] geom_text() is similar to geom_point(), but it has an additional aesthetic: label. This makes it possible to add textual labels to your plots. fontface and size arguments we can customize the look of the text labels. [geom_text()] Use geom_hline() and geom_vline() to add reference lines. We often make them thick (linewidth = 2) and white (color = white), and draw them underneath the primary data layer. [geom_hline(); geom_vline()] Use geom_rect() to draw a rectangle around points of interest. The boundaries of the rectangle are defined by aesthetics xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax. [geom_rect()] Use geom_segment() with the arrow argument to draw attention to a point with an arrow. Use aesthetics x and y to define the starting location, and xend and yend to define the end location. [geom_segment()] Another handy function for adding annotations to plots is annotate(). As a rule of thumb, geoms are generally useful for highlighting a subset of the data while annotate() is useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot.
